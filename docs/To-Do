Starship Control Demo To-Do List

Done InProg Ignor Task
[ ]  [ ]    [ ]   1. Remove Starfield Animation and Limit Displayed Objects
                 - Remove the "rushing stars" effect in Nav and Science maps.
                 Only display objects (e.g., stars, asteroids) listed in
                 world.html's sim, based on World station's object list.

[ ]  [ ]    [ ]   2. Add Radar Sweep Animation to Nav and Science
                 - Add a radar sweep anim (e.g., rotating line or arc) to both
                 Nav and Science maps to show radar activity.

[ ]  [ ]    [ ]   3. Implement Separate Sensors for Nav and Science with Scanner
                 Power Mechanics
                 - Nav gets its own sensors, separate from Science's.
                 - Nav sensors:
                   - Can have 360° FOV at a baseline range.
                   - Use a "scanner power" mechanic: [Scanner Power] / [FOV] =
                   [Range].
                   - Nav's scanner power is half of Science's (e.g., if
                   Science's scanner power is 600, Nav's is 300).
                   - At 360° FOV, Nav's range is half of Science's; reducing FOV
                   increases range proportionally.
                 - Science retains full-power sensors with the same mechanic:
                 [Scanner Power] / [FOV] = [Range].
                 - Scanner power is adjustable:
                   - Higher scanner power increases range (or allows wider FOV)
                   but consumes more of Eng's power production.
                   - Lower scanner power reduces consumption but limits range or
                   FOV.

[ ]  [ ]    [ ]   4. Enhance World Station Reporting with Separate Sensors
                 - World tracks all objects and reports to stations when
                 relevant:
                   - Science: Report objects within its radar range, FOV, and
                   direction, based on its scanner power settings.
                   - Nav: Report objects within its own (weaker) radar range,
                   FOV, and direction, based on its scanner power settings.
                   - All stations: Report collisions between objects (e.g., ship
                   hitting an asteroid), as everyone would notice.
                 - Don't send updates about objects stations can't see based on
                 their respective radar configurations.

[ ]  [ ]    [ ]   5. Update Nav Map Orientation
                 - Nav map should show the ship icon pointing up (forward) by
                 default, using its own radar data. Allow the navigator to rotate
                 the map if requested.

[ ]  [ ]    [ ]   6. Add Alert Status Indicator to All Stations Except World
                 - Add an alert status indicator (e.g., color-coded light or
                 text) to Nav, Eng, and Science screens to show the ship's alert
                 status (e.g., green for normal, yellow for caution, red for
                 danger).
                 - World, as a server utility, should not have this immersive
                 element.

[ ]  [ ]    [ ]   7. Enhance Eng with Power Production and Consumption Display
                 - Add a display to Eng showing:
                   - Total power production.
                   - Power consumption breakdown (e.g., from Nav and Science
                   sensors, other systems).
                 - Eng controls power production:
                   - Higher production burns fuel faster and wears components
                   down faster.
                   - Eng can reroute power to prioritize systems if needed.

[ ]  [ ]    [ ]   8. Update Ops Station for Power Allocation
                 - Ops station (logistical role) controls power allocation to
                 each station.
                 - Ops decides how much power each station (e.g., Nav, Science,
                 Eng systems) gets from Eng's total production.
                 - Tie this into the scanner power mechanics: Ops allocates power
                 to Nav and Science for their sensors, affecting their scanner
                 power.

[ ]  [ ]    [ ]   9. Expand Station Roles
                 - Add more bridge roles like Tactical (weapons) for a full crew
                 (Ops already added).

[ ]  [ ]    [ ]   10. Polish Eng UI
                 - Add visual elements like a power gauge to Eng and match the
                 dark theme of other stations.

[ ]  [ ]    [ ]   11. Test Slider Sync
                 - Test adjusting power (Eng) and throttle (Nav) to ensure speed
                 syncs across stations.

[ ]  [ ]    [ ]   12. Check Radar Direction
                 - Verify Science's radar direction slider updates the map
                 correctly (currently at 360°, might be stuck). Ensure Nav's
                 radar direction (if adjustable) works too.
