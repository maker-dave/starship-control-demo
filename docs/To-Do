Starship Control Demo To-Do List

Done InProg Ignor Task
[ ]  [ ]    [ ]   1. Remove Starfield Animation and Limit Displayed Objects
[ ]  [ ]    [ ]     - Remove the "rushing stars" effect in Nav and Science maps.
[ ]  [ ]    [ ]     - Only display objects (e.g., stars, asteroids) listed in
                        world.html's sim, based on World station's object list.

[ ]  [ ]    [ ]   2. Add Radar Sweep Animation to Nav and Science
[ ]  [ ]    [ ]     - Add a radar sweep anim (e.g., rotating line or arc) to both
                        Nav and Science maps to show radar activity.

[ ]  [ ]    [ ]   3. Implement Separate Sensors for Nav and Science with Scanner
                 Power Mechanics
[ ]  [ ]    [ ]     - Nav gets its own sensors, separate from Science's.
[ ]  [ ]    [ ]     - Nav sensors:
[ ]  [ ]    [ ]       - Can have 360° FOV at a baseline range.
[ ]  [ ]    [ ]       - Use a "scanner power" mechanic: [Scanner Power] / [FOV] =
                        [Range].
[ ]  [ ]    [ ]       - Nav's scanner power is half of Science's (e.g., if
                        Science's scanner power is 600, Nav's is 300).
[ ]  [ ]    [ ]       - At 360° FOV, Nav's range is half of Science's; reducing
                        FOV increases range proportionally.
[ ]  [ ]    [ ]     - Science retains full-power sensors with the same mechanic:
                        [Scanner Power] / [FOV] = [Range].
[ ]  [ ]    [ ]     - Scanner power is adjustable:
[ ]  [ ]    [ ]       - Higher scanner power increases range (or allows wider
                        FOV) but consumes more of Eng's power production.
[ ]  [ ]    [ ]       - Lower scanner power reduces consumption but limits range
                        or FOV.
[ ]  [ ]    [ ]     - Clients (Nav, Science) calculate their own range and filter
                        objects locally using P2P data from World.
[ ]  [ ]    [ ]     - Eng sends power production data to Nav and Science via P2P.
[ ]  [ ]    [ ]     - Ops sends power allocation to Nav and Science via P2P, which
                        they use to adjust scanner power locally.

[ ]  [ ]    [ ]   4. Enhance World Station Reporting with Separate Sensors
[ ]  [ ]    [ ]     - World tracks all objects and broadcasts their positions to
                        all stations via P2P every 1 sec (as per Version 0.9).
[ ]  [ ]    [ ]     - Nav and Science filter objects locally based on their own
                        radar settings (range, FOV, direction, scanner power).
[ ]  [ ]    [ ]     - World detects collisions between objects (e.g., ship hitting
                        an asteroid) and broadcasts to all stations via P2P.
[ ]  [ ]    [ ]     - World sends periodic state updates to the server during
                        inactivity for client restoration.

[ ]  [ ]    [ ]   5. Update Nav Map Orientation
[ ]  [ ]    [ ]     - Nav map should show the ship icon pointing up (forward) by
                        default, using its own radar data. Allow the navigator to
                        rotate the map if requested.

[ ]  [ ]    [ ]   6. Add Alert Status Indicator to All Stations Except World
[ ]  [ ]    [ ]     - Add an alert status indicator (e.g., color-coded light or
                        text) to Nav, Eng, and Science screens to show the ship's
                        alert status (e.g., green for normal, yellow for caution,
                        red for danger).
[ ]  [ ]    [ ]     - World, as a server utility, should not have this immersive
                        element.

[ ]  [ ]    [ ]   7. Enhance Eng with Power Production and Consumption Display
[ ]  [ ]    [ ]     - Add a display to Eng showing:
[ ]  [ ]    [ ]       - Total power production.
[ ]  [ ]    [ ]       - Power consumption breakdown (e.g., from Nav and Science
                        sensors, other systems).
[ ]  [ ]    [ ]     - Eng controls power production:
[ ]  [ ]    [ ]       - Higher production burns fuel faster and wears components
                        down faster.
[ ]  [ ]    [ ]       - Eng can reroute power to prioritize systems if needed.
[ ]  [ ]    [ ]     - Eng sends power production data to Ops, Nav, and Science via
                        P2P.
[ ]  [ ]    [ ]     - Eng sends periodic state updates to the server during
                        inactivity.

[ ]  [ ]    [ ]   8. Update Ops Station for Power Allocation
[ ]  [ ]    [ ]     - Ops station (logistical role) controls power allocation to
                        each station.
[ ]  [ ]    [ ]     - Ops decides how much power each station (e.g., Nav, Science,
                        Eng systems) gets from Eng's total production.
[ ]  [ ]    [ ]     - Ops sends power allocation to Nav, Science, and other
                        stations via P2P.
[ ]  [ ]    [ ]     - Nav and Science adjust their scanner power locally based on
                        Ops' allocation.
[ ]  [ ]    [ ]     - Ops sends periodic state updates to the server during
                        inactivity.

[ ]  [ ]    [ ]   9. Expand Station Roles
[ ]  [ ]    [ ]     - Add more bridge roles like Tactical (weapons) for a full
                        crew (Ops already added).
[ ]  [ ]    [ ]     - New stations send periodic state updates to the server
                        during inactivity.

[ ]  [ ]    [ ]   10. Polish Eng UI
                 - Add visual elements like a power gauge to Eng and match the
                 dark theme of other stations.

[ ]  [ ]    [ ]   11. Test Slider Sync
                 - Test adjusting power (Eng) and throttle (Nav) to ensure speed
                 syncs across stations.

[ ]  [ ]    [ ]   12. Check Radar Direction
                 - Verify Science's radar direction slider updates the map
                 correctly (currently at 360°, might be stuck). Ensure Nav's
                 radar direction (if adjustable) works too.
